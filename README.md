# 100 Days of Python, AI, and Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ **Description**
Welcome to the **100 Days of Python, AI, and Machine Learning** challenge!  
This is a learning challenge I created to improve my skills in **Python Programming**, **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence**. The goal of this challenge is to help me (and possibly you) grasp both basic and advanced concepts, and build real-world projects using the skills learned.

Every day, I will be adding explanations of what I've learned, code examples, and challenges faced. My goal is to not only understand the theory but also build a portfolio of projects that showcase my abilities in these fields.

---

## ðŸ’¡ **Objective of This Challenge**
- Learn **Python** from basics to advanced.
- Understand the core concepts of **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**.
- Build **AI** projects that can be applied in real-world scenarios.
- Document my daily learning to share with my audience.
- Create a portfolio that showcases my skills for career development.
